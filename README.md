## These are my completed exercise files from the Pluralsight course "Redux Saga" by Daniel Stern

### I fully understood the following key concepts from this course:
  + Implementing Redux and it's middlewares to create highly maintainable and performant data models.
  + Utilizing Redux Saga and how to implement effects and channels.
  + Using ES6 generator functions
  + Testing Redux Saga Applicatons.
  
### Application
A fully-functional shopping cart built with Redux Saga using Yield - Run with accompanying server.
  + redux-saga-cart folder contains the Frontend.
  + redux-saga-shopping-cart-server folder contains the server.
  
### How to run:
  + Download both of the folders to your local machine.
  + Run "npm install && npm start" command in the redux-saga-shopping-cart-server folder to kick-off the server.
  + Then, run "npm install && npm start" command in the redux-saga-cart folder to run the Frontend.
